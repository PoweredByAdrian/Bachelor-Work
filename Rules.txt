Rules

1.
Player
chooses a side of the gameboard and places his Duke
Tile in one of the two center
squares in his edge row (or
home edge). He then places
his two Footman Tiles in
any two squares that share a
side with the Duke; sharing
only a corner is not allowed.
The second player
does not have to place his Duke Tile exactly opposite his opponent’s Duke Tile.

2.
Orientation: Each Troop Tile must be placed on the gameboard with its name oriented directly toward the player who controls the tile. Regardless of where a tile moves
    or where on the board new tiles are placed, they must always be oriented toward the
    controlling player, and remain so throughout the game.
Starting Side: Each Troop Tile has a starting icon on its “starting” side, with another
    icon on the reverse, or “non-starting” side. All tiles placed on the board for the first time,
    whether at the start of the game or added during the game, must be placed with the starting icon visible.

3.
Each turn, a player must do one (and only
one) of the following:

	 •	 Move a Troop Tile: Move a Troop Tile
on the gameboard using any legal move
as shown by its movement profile,
flipping it over to its reverse side once
the move is done.

	 •	 Place a New Troop Tile: Pull a
random Troop Tile from the player’s
bag and place it on the gameboard
in an unoccupied square sharing a
side with the square occupied by the
player’s Duke.

	 •	 Use an Enhanced Ability (optional):
Use a single enhanced ability from a
single tile. This only applies if players
are using any Enhanced Tiles (see p. 7).

A player can never pass; he either moves
a Troop Tile, places a new one, or uses an Enhanced Ability every turn.

4.
Move A Troop Tile
During each player’s turn, he may choose
to move any single Troop Tile he controls on
the gameboard, flipping it over to its reverse
side once the move is completed. Each tile has
a movement grid (or profile); the space in the
center of the grid shows the Troop Tile’s current
square as it corresponds to the gameboard, and
the other movement icons show the squares
that this Troop Tile may interact with on the
gameboard. The icon(s) in a given square in the
movement grid determines how the Troop Tile
interacts with that location during a move.

###############################################

    Move: This icon allows a Troop Tile
to move to the indicated square if
there is a clear and straight path to it
from the starting square (the square
the tile occupies on the gameboard).
If there is a friendly or enemy Troop
Tile in between the starting and
target squares, then the move cannot
be made. Likewise, the move cannot
be made if there is a friendly Troop
Tile in the target square. If there
is an enemy in the target square,
however, the move can be made and
the player captures the enemy tile
(see Capturing Tiles, on next page).
    Jump: This icon allows a Troop
Tile to move to the square shown,
jumping over any Troop Tile (friend
or enemy) along a shortest path
from the starting square to the target
square. If there is a friendly Troop
Tile in the target square, the move
cannot be made. If there is an enemy
in the target square, the move can be
made and the enemy tile is captured
(see Capturing Tiles, on next page).
Nothing happens to the Troop Tiles
that were jumped over.
    Slide: This icon allows a Troop Tile
to move any number of squares in
the direction shown, as long as it
has a clear path. The Troop Tile
may not jump over any pieces. If
it ends its turn in an opponent’s
square, the controlling player
captures that piece (see Capturing
Tiles, on next page); it cannot end
its movement in a square occupied
by a friendly tile.
    Jump Slide: This icon follows
the exact rules for Slide, with
the following addition: this icon
allows a Troop Tile to move in the
direction of the Jump Slide icon
and completely ignore any tile
that might be adjacent, along the
direction indicated. (This will not
allow a tile to Jump Slide past the
Mountain Tile.)
    Strike: This icon allows a Troop
Tile to capture from afar. Remove
an enemy Troop Tile in one of the
squares indicated by this icon (see
Capturing Tiles, at right), but leave
the Troop Tile in its original location;
using this icon does not move the
Troop Tile, but the Tile still flips. This
icon has no effect on a friendly tile.
    Command: A Troop Tile with these
symbols can move other Troop
Tiles around it. Instead of moving
this Troop Tile, the player moves
one of the Troop Tiles he controls
from any square indicated by one of
these symbols to any other square
indicated by one of these symbols;
though this tile does not move, it still
flips, as always. If the Troop Tile that
was moved ends its turn in a square
occupied by an enemy tile, capture
that tile (see Capturing Tiles, at right);
a tile cannot end its move in a square
occupied by a friendly tile.
The Mountain Tile (see p. 8) does
not block Command movement in
any way (a tile still cannot end its
movement in a Mountain Tile). No
other tiles block a Command move
in any way; the moving tile simply
can move from any square with the
Command icon to any other square
with the Command icon.

##########

5.
Flip the Tile: In all instances above, at the
end of a player’s turn (after a movement icon
has been used), the Troop Tile that used an
icon is flipped to the other side. If the Troop Tile
moved to a new square, it is turned to the new
side after reaching the new square. If Strike or
Command icons are used, the player still flips
the Troop Tile, even though the tile didn’t move.
When using the Command icon, the Troop Tile
that is moved does not flip; only the Troop Tile
that initiated the move is flipped (that is, the tile
that used the Command icon).

6.
Capturing Tiles: Any time a Troop Tile ends
its move in a square occupied by an opponent’s
Troop Tile, remove the opposing piece from the
gameboard (simply place it next to the board).
Whenever a player moves a tile that will allow
him to capture his opponent’s Duke on his
following turn, he must say “Guard.”

7.
Putting the Duke Tile in Danger: A
player cannot move a Troop Tile if it would
allow the opponent to capture his Duke Tile (or
any tile acting as the Duke) in the next turn.

8.
place a new Troop Tile
During each player’s turn, instead of moving
a Troop Tile he controls, he may place a new
Troop Tile on the gameboard.
Draw a random Troop Tile from the
appropriate bag and place it starting side
up (marked with a starting icon) in any
empty square that shares a side with
your Duke (sharing only a corner is not
allowed); remember to place it with the correct
orientation (see Orientation, p. 2). If the controlling player’s Duke is surrounded (either by
the controlling player’s or the opponent’s Troop
Tiles, or the edge of the gameboard), a new Troop
Tile may not be placed; a player must instead
move a tile already on the gameboard (see p. 3).
Once a tile is removed from the bag, it must
be placed on the board, even if it is automatically in danger of being captured next turn.
If a player’s bag runs out of Troop Tiles, that
player can no longer place new tiles during this
game; the player must move a tile every turn.

9.
Winning the game
The game is won as soon as a player captures the opponent’s Duke Tile.
